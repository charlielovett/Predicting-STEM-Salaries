# Data Science 303-3 Final Project
In this project, we developed a model to predict salaries for employees in STEM fields. We used modeling techniques including Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost along with model ensembling to achieve an MAE on test data of ~47,000. This project was completed in June of 2023.
