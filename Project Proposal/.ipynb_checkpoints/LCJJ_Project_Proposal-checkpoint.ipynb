    "Through this project, we will attempt to predict the salaries for employees that work in STEM fields. As we are predicting salaries, the response observed in this project is a continuous variable—their annunal salary in USD. We will assess our model accuracy using MAE. We have selected this metric instead of RMSE as there is no inherit risk or disadvantage in incorrectly predicting observations by a large margin."

One key observation this study reported was that general experience and years at the company were the most influential factors. \n",

This data scientist used all the variables as predictors incorporating dummy variables where needed. Their response variable was base salary. They then tested their final model on a validation test dataset and found a final MAE of ~13.6512. "

Firstly, students pursuing a career in STEM would definitely be interested in this data. Although compensation does not drive most student's professional path, it certainly is a factor that holds weight. Secondly, colleges and universities would benefit from our group's analysis. By understanding which roles are in the highest demand in our society, they may place more emphasis on prioritizing resources and professors in those academic areas. Thirdly, employees would be interested in our findings to ensure that their compensation is fair relative to industry standards, giving them the opportunity to negotiate for higher pay. Fourthly, in the same way, our analysis could benefit employees, employers would benefit as they could see how their compensation packages compare to their competitor's compensation packages allowing them to understand better how they are attracting talent in these fields and how to make the open positions more attractive to prospective employees.
